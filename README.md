# Bioinformatics-Problems 🧬👨‍💻
My solutions for Bioinformatics related problems from the site "Rosalind" (https://rosalind.info/)


Each folder in this repository corresponds to a problem from Rosalind and contains:
1. a `.py` file for my solution for the problem, 
2. a `.txt` file for corresponding dataset, and
3. a `readme.md` file containing link to the correspoding problem.
